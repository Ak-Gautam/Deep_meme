‚è´ This is one of the things you will be able to do by following this workshop even with your image or video.

### Simple intro to [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence), [ML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning), [DL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) and [Deep-Fakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deepfake)
AI is one of those technologies which has changed (and going to change) the world completely, it can be easily compared to inventions like wheels and transistors. 
Machine Learning is a method under AI which uses data, math and code together to make machines intelligentüß†. It's almost similar to how a living being learns, we see a spoon daily and then we know it's a spoon based on it's characteristics. Deep Learning is a method under ML which uses more complex maths, Neural Networks and lots of computations power to achieve greater feats such as self-driving cars.
